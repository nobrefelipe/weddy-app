`STATUS: NOT COMPLETED`

This if my first real world app  I am developing using flutter.
It is a sort of social network for guests of an wedding.

### The idea

People love to take and share pictures of their social life, specially in weddings.
The idea of the app is to make it simpler for the guests to get all the pictures the other guests are taking.
So no one needs to ask anybody to send the pictures over.
